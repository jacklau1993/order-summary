## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is the first time I try a coding challenge after finishing basic HTML and CSS module from Angela Yu's bootcamp. During the building process, I found that what have been taught in the course are very basic. They may help me build a structure of the website, but when I try to style the webpage I found it not enough. Therefore I go to youtube and search for more CSS tutorials and I applied in this challenge, including flex and button.

```div
<div class="card"></div>
```

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### Continued development

I will keep on trying different coding challenges. Meanwhile keep watching tutorials on different topics about CSS and HTML. Also, I will keep my progress on the bootcamp to learn JavaScript and so on.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me a lot in finding out the css property and syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
